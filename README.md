To run the program with the previous examples, follow the instructions below:

Save the script in a file named TrKBuster.sh in the desired directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the TrKbrute.sh script is located.

Give execution permission to the script using the command:
chmod +x TrKBuster.sh

Now, you just need to execute it, replacing the values with the desired parameters.
